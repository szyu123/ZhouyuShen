I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Econometrics and Statistics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where I am advised by [Prof. Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/). My research lies in the intersection of econometrics, statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on providing theoretical guarantees for applying machine learning methods in the field of economics and finance.
